      "I read somewhere that people come to Auckland to do two things: 1. Visit Aquarium 2. Leave. ",
      "We didn't visit the aquarium. Instead we decided to look for 'Giant Pink Phallus' as suggested by our smart phone guide. ",
      "Although we walked a lot around we could not find it! Auckland Domain, the oldest park there was quite charming though."

      "Arriving in Hamilton the day before, we rented out a car early in the morning. ",
      "Even though Asok doesn't have a license and my driving experience is less than 200 km in my entire life, getting a car is surprisingly easy!. ",
      "The 180 km nervous drive towards Coromandel Peninsula involved getting the finger a few times because of our slow driving."

    "description": [
      "The Lost World. Yes that's where we rappeled on day 3. We went down into a 100m hole using just a rope. ",
      "Just like in the movies, only safer! And that was not the best part of the day. Watching the milky way was. From a forest full of glow worms."

      "It was time to say goodbye to Hamilton. We drove towards Rotorua on day 4. Oh yeah, we stopped by Hobbiton on the way. ",
      " Later part of the day was spent in Hells Gate, on of the many geo-thermal parks in Rotorua area. ",
      "Hells gate is the opposite of an oasis. It was barren in the middle of never ending greenery NZ is!"

    "description": [
      "The highlight of the day was jumping off a plane from 15,000 feet over lake Taupo. We don't have any photos of the jump! ",
      "Instead have a look at Champagne pool of Wai-O-Tapu thermal park and Huka falls."

    "description": [
      "After a very early morning flight to Queenstown, we drove to the Kawarau bridge to make another jump. This time from only 43m. ",
      "Rest of the day was spent driving to lake Tekapo youth hostel. We passed another lake, Pukaki on our way. ",
      "Both these lake have a very distinct blue colour because of the suspended silt."

      "Towards the end of the trip I grew confident in my driving skills. May be too confident, that I ended up getting a speeding ticket :(. ",

      "The last day of our trip involved our longest drive, 400 km one way! Milford Sound was worth it though. ",
